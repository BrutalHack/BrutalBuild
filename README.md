BrutalBuild is a package used internally at BrutalHack to semi-automate builds using Unity.
While it is slightly outdated (we should switch from XML to Unity 6 Build Profiles), this may be a useful reference for other developers aiming to do the same.

It is not ready to just be dropped in a project and used, sorry.

If you are working on your own build automation, this reference may still help you though.
